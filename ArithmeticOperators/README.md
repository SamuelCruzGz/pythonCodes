# Arithmetic Operators
## Task
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, _a_ and _b_. Add code to print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

## Example
__a__ = __3__
__b__ = __5__

Print the following 
```
8
-2
15
```

## Input format
The first line contains the first integer, _a_.
The second line contains the second integer, _b_.

## Constraints
1 ≤ _a_ ≤ 10<sup>10</sup>
1 ≤ _b_ ≤ 10<sup>10</sup>

## Output format
Print the three lines as explained above.
